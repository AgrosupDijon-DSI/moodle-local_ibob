# Inscription by open badges #

Ibob and Ibobenrol add a new enrolment method in courses, subject to the possession of a particular open badges.

It is a duo of plugins enabling users to enrol in courses via their Open Badges.

The first plugin (enrol_ibobenrol) lets you add a registration method to a course :
Teachers can add the "Enrolment by Open Badge" enrolment method to their courses.
He chooses the badge(s) required for the course from among the Open Badges held by platform users.
Access to the course is thus open to users who hold one or more of these Open Badges.

The second plugin (local_ibob) manages notifications and emails sent to users, as well as the retrieval of public Open Badges stored in users' Open Badge Passport accounts and the updating of profiles in the Moodle platform via scheduled tasks.
